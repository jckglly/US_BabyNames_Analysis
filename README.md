# US_BabyNames_Analysis
This was a data analysis project completed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. The aim of this project was to gain an insight into the trends of baby names since records began.

My approach to preparing the data was:
- to ensure that the fields and field labels were correct.
- to ensure that the data types of the fields were correct.
- to ensure there were no missing values.

I wanted to explore the data to see what the 5 most popular names were for boys and girls since the first year in the data.

I chose to examine the impact of popular individuals/charcters on baby names as my next insight. The following are categories I used in my exploration:
- Popular Athletes (Conor McGregor, Cassius Clay)
- Popular Singers (Britney Spears, Elvis Presley)
- Popular Actors and Characters (Forrest Gump, Kylo Ren)

After completing this project, I identified that further analysis could be done in relation to popularity of a name in the future.
